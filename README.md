# Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing for Marketing

Documents/source codes related to [Manning live project](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/sentiment-analysis-and-natural-language-processing-for-marketing).

## Techniques Employed

Here is a short list about what you will do and what techniques you will use.

   * Sampling from imbalanced datasets using the imbalanced-learn package
   * Enquiring about the sentiment value of the reviews with the dictionary-based sentiment analysis tools, which are part of NLTK, a natural language processing toolkit, used in Python.
   * Finding out if your algorithm did a good job. Data evaluation with scikit-learn in Python.
   * Analyzing the reviews with a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, namely with the DistilBERT model. To build this model, you will need to run Pytorch, transformers, and the simpletransformers packages.
   * Evaluating your model and creating descriptive statistics in Python with scikit-learn library before reporting your results to your boss.
   * Visualizing your findings about preferable and non-preferable words related to video games using Altair.
   
## Project Outline

The project is made up of five steps, which are built on each other:

   * Creating your dataset.
   * Creating a dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
   * Evaluating your dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
   * Creating neural network-based sentiment analyzers.
   * Reporting your results.

## Dataset

The Amazon review dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). Download the zipped json file of the category of video games 5 core, which can be found under the title Small subsets for experimentation. Once the download is complete, extract the file.
